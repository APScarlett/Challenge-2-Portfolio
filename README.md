# Challenge-2-Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I am here in this class to pursue a new career path. I built this project to test my knowledge and receive critique on how and where
I can improve. This project provides a one stop location to house all the work I have completed during my time in this class and future projects. I learned coding can be difficult but I rather enjoy it. I learned how to use CSS and HTML at a basic level and I am looking forward to learning more.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Usage
This project is simply a Portfolio to show off what I have created thus far on my coding bootcamp Journey.
